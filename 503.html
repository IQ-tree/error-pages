<h1>503 Service Unavailable</h1>
<ul>
<li>You (Browser) : OK</li>
<li>Host (Cloudflare) : OK</li>
<li>Server (Adevkit SEND, InfinityFree) : Error</li>
</li>
<h3>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload (Might be DDoS attack) or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.</h3>
<p>The server MAY send a Retry-After header field1 to suggest an appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before retrying the request.

Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server has to use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers might simply refuse the connection.</p>
